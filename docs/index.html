	<h1>Business Size Analysis</h1>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<section>
		<p>We learned a lot both inside and outside of our project. We learned that unless you actually are able to obtain the data you are looking for, you probably aren’t going to find it.  Also, being super specific in asking questions without having a way to get the data you need in order answer them doesn’t help either. Our proposal changed significantly three times. It is also incredibly easy to run down rabbit holes once you do find a lot of data. While looking through the Census data, we found so much information that we all went in different directions to see what we could find about small businesses, medium businesses and large businesses. </p>

		<p>We finally decided on these questions to answer:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Is there any correlation between Minimum Wage, business size, and number of establishments?</li>
			<li>Is there a correlation between the number of business sizes establishments and key measures of economic growth?</li>
			<li>Does the employee size of the business matter? Between small, medium, and large size businesses which one has the greatest correlation to positive overall economic stability.</li>
			<li>What is the ideal business size an employee would want to work on a personal perspective?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Findings:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Business size does affect the outcome annual pay.  The larger the business, the more annual pay an employee will have. This might be due to CEOs of large companies making more with a higher profit. Also some smaller businesses may not make a whole lot of money because they are just beginning.</li>
			<li>Minimum wage does not affect business size as much as population does affect business size. The higher the population, the more businesses. There seems to be no true correlation between minimum wage and its effect on businesses.</li>
			<li>Population density between states does seem to influence minimum wage. It looks like the higher the population density the more likely the state is to have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum wage of $7.25.</li>
		</ul>
